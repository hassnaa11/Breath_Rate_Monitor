# Breath Rate Monitor

<p>
Abnormal breathing syndromes are disorders that occur in the breathing system which may be fatal if not diagnosed correctly. The disorders we are detecting here are bradypnea and tachypnea.

Simply, the project idea is to measure the breath rate and inhalation and exhalation time. We use ultrasonic sensor for this measurements. We print patientâ€™s condition on the serial monitor If patient breathe slower than normal it is Bradypnea and faster than normal is Tachypnea.
